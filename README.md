3D printable parts for a quadcopter

This design is heavily based on the PL2Q Hugin (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19161) by swepet and the OpenSCAD port of the same, called PLSQ Leshy (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22711), by polymaker.

The main modification is that this design is for circular carbon fiber arms, and uses sliced body parts that are designed to screw together to compress around the carbon fiber.
